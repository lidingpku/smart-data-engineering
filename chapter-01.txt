2. Discussion -- growth mode: 
does startup always have exponetial growth? Paulgram was right on social-network based viral market, but not necessary true in other domain.

6. discussion: unique value proposition: Disruptive innovation: 
OEM vs language
* language and OEM is not generated by purly design, but rather by induction from a community.
*  consumer market and enterpise market are different: the former one is emerged from the mass but enterprise market are conveged from multiple big players. 


7. software is eating the world, by order
- open source (software itself)
- e-commerce
- publishing
- automobile
- education
- financial 
- healthcare (not yet) 
- government
- researech 

facets:
* legal regulation(inference); 
* standardization(software)(repetitive work); 

The stronger the current players in an industry, the harder to eat it

Regulation
* is good for startup that there is no/lite regulation for data privacy, storage, sagety
* when there are some, it will be barriers for new comers
